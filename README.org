* Features
** Modal binds (like emacs, ratpoison, stumpwm)

Keyboard chorded modal.  Type =C-i c c= to open a terminal.  Type =C-i c w= to
open a web browser.  Type =C-i 1= to focus client index one.  Type =C-i g 1= to
focus workspace index one.  See [[file:modal.lua][modal.lua]] for a complete list of bindings.

** Gaps

Gaps support if you want it.

** Cleaner codebase

Sections of the configuration are split up into many files.  This helps keep
the lua easy to read and organized by usage.

* Layout
In general ~require './file'~ should not run code, only import
functions. As such every relative require in =rc.lua= should be used
in some sort of function application.
